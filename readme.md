# Intent

A strong accent on typography, black and white.

The goal is to allow to focus on the content and use a typography
flow to guide the reader on what's important.

# Framework

This is based on Foundation 6 + Zurb Template. 

## Installation

(These instructions are based on the Zurb template README).

```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

Finally, run `npm start` to run Gulp. Your finished site will be created in a folder called `dist`, viewable at this URL:
